## Overview
This project is a responsive sign-up page featuring a working form with error handling. It utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive user experience. Users can input their first name, last name, email address, and password to sign up for a service.

## Features
- Responsive layout: The page layout adjusts dynamically based on the screen size, ensuring a consistent user experience across devices.
- Form validation: JavaScript is used to validate form inputs, providing real-time feedback to users and preventing submission of invalid data.
- Error handling: Error messages are displayed next to input fields to indicate any validation errors and guide users in correcting their inputs.
- Submission button: Upon successful validation, users can submit the form to sign up for the service.

## Usage
To use this sign-up page:

1. Copy the provided HTML code into your HTML file.
2. Link the provided CSS file (`style.css`) in the `<head>` section of your HTML file.
3. Include the provided JavaScript code (`index.js`) at the end of the `<body>` section of your HTML file.
4. Customize the content and styling as needed to match your specific requirements.

## HTML Structure
The HTML structure consists of elements for the header, form container, and form inputs. Error messages are displayed alongside input fields for validation feedback.

## CSS Styling
The CSS file (`style.css`) contains custom styling for the page layout, form elements, and error messages. You can customize colors, fonts, sizes, and layout properties to match your design preferences.

## JavaScript Functionality
The JavaScript code (`index.js`) handles form validation and error handling. It checks for empty fields and validates the email format before allowing form submission. Error messages are displayed dynamically based on user input.
